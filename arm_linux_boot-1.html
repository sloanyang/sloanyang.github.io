<h2><a name="s1">1.</a> <a href="http://amitshah.bizhat.com/arm/arm_linux_boot.html#toc1">Boot Structure</a></h2>

<p>The boot process for a machine is configured from the makefile
located at: linux/arch/arm/boot/Makefile</p>
<h2><a name="ss1.1">1.1</a> <a href="http://amitshah.bizhat.com/arm/arm_linux_boot.html#toc1.1">boot/Makefile</a>
</h2>

<p>This file normally defines the name of the kernel built, and
some linker specific options.</p>
<p>This is the output of the build which is not in any specific
binary / object format that is executable. This is the raw kernel
which can be used for debugging or asm dumps. </p>
<p>
</p><pre>SYSTEM = $(TOPDIR)/vmlinux
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>These variables decide the actually uncompressing of the kernel</p>
<p>
</p><pre>ZTEXTADDR - Address where zImage is located by the bootloader 
ZRELADDR - Address where the zImage will be relocated
PARAMS_PHYS - Address where tagged parameters are to be found
INITRD_PHYS - Physical Address of the Ramdisk
ZBSSADDR - Address where the real kernel should execute from
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>To define these for a specific architecture, you would have:</p>
<p>(these values are for the xScale PXA250)</p>
<p>
</p><pre>ifeq($(CONFIG_ARCH_MYARCH),y)
ZRELADDR = 0xA0008000
PARAMS_PHYS = 0xA0000100
endif
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>INITRD_PHYS and ZBSSADDR would depend on the actual architecture
and requirements, but these two parameters are vital to start any
compressed zImage. If you aren't using a compressed zImage, then
you might still have to set PARAMS_PHYS to setup tagged parameters.</p>
<p>You will probably still be able to pass parameters through tags
if you want the kernel to locate a ramdisk.</p>
<p>PARAMS_PHYS will point to the tagged parameters which have been
placed by a boot loader. </p>
<h2><a name="ss1.2">1.2</a> <a href="http://amitshah.bizhat.com/arm/arm_linux_boot.html#toc1.2">boot/compressed/head-machine.S</a>
</h2>

<p>For each machine type, there is a specific head-machine.S which
sets machine specific options. This could be head-xscale.S or head-netwinder.S
or head-sa1100.S or head-clps7500.S depending on the actual machine
and is selected through linux/arch/arm/boot/compressed/Makefile</p>
<p>This is linked INTO head.S and not before head.S, it executes
inside head.S after some initial code is executed.</p>
<h3>An Example: head-xscale.S</h3>

<p>.start is defined here and is the actual execution start of the
architecture specific header. </p>
<p>The next thing done is to flush the cache by traversing memory
larger than twice the largest possible size of a D-Cache (This technique
seems to be used in more than one place during the kernel start).</p>

<p>Most of the code here is to switch on machine specific options,
which cannot/should not be included in head.S directly.</p>
<p>
</p><pre>#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_&lt;em&gt;MACHNAME
r7 := #MACH_TYPE_&lt;em&gt;MACHNAME
#endif
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Optionally, the architecture id (MACH_TYPE_MACHNAME) is hardcoded
inside the decompresser. In case the bootloader (like Blob) can decompress
the kernel from itself, this would not be required as the entry code
of the kernel can read the architecture number from the registers
passed to it. I assume that either the initial registers passed to
the decompresser will have to be preserved (the boot-loader document
specifies that we have to set r0 - 0, r1 - MACH_TYPE_<em>MACHNAME</em>, r2
- PARAMS_PHYS). we now enter continue through the common section
of head.S (just after start:) </p>
<h2><a name="ss1.3">1.3</a> <a href="http://amitshah.bizhat.com/arm/arm_linux_boot.html#toc1.3">linux/arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S</a>
</h2>

<p>This is the entry header for the kernel decompressing routine
and is actually located at: linux/arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S</p>
<h3>Debugging </h3>

<p>The file actually starts with definitions for code required for
debugging (serial debugging) before the decompression actually starts.</p>
<p><em>#ifdef DEBUG</em></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>raw serial debug functions are hard-coded into this file. They
are used for printing messages during the decompression process much
before control is transferred to the actual kernel.</li>
<li>serial functions are defined on the basis of two macros <em>loadsp</em>
and <em>writeb</em>. </li>
<li>the basic debugging macros are phex and putc which are provided
as wrapped macros as kphex and kputc.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The following macros are used by kphex and kputc internally and
need to be defined should you need debugging support on the platform
at this stage</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>writeb <em>operand</em>, writes a byte into the serial port</li>
<li>loadsp <em>operand</em>: operand must always be r3, if you want to use
writeb whose operand directly MUST NOT be r3. </li>
<li>loadsp places the base address for the serial port to r3, while
writeb stores its operand into the right offset to the actual serial
port.</li>
<li>loadsp probably means "load serial port" - it actually
loads the serial port base address</li>
<li>writeb probably means "write byte" - this actually
writes a byte into the serial port</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>observation:</b></dt><dd><p>this macro can be defined for any new architecture
if you need debug messages before the kernel is uncompressed.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>there are two macros 'debug_reloc_start' and 'debug_reloc_end'
defined on the basis of the prior macros. They are used to dump the
process id</li>
<li>if you have these macros for the architecture you're working
on, then you get the address where the kernel loads and a kernel
dump. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><em>#endif /* DEBUG */</em></p>
<h3>Bootstrapping and Relocating</h3>

<p>The actual code execution starts here:</p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>start:</b></dt><dd>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>the bootloader has called the kernel zImage after placing 0 in
r0 and the architecture number in r1, these values are now preserved.
PS: we don't check if r0 was set as 0 out here, we just make an assumption
and use only r1 (preserving it for later use)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><pre>.word 0x016f2818 @ Magic numbers to help the loader
.word start @ absolute load/run zImage address 
.word _edata @ zImage end address
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>"start" and "_edata" contain the offsets to start: and _edata: for
the zImage. They are intended to assist in relocating the kernel.</p>
<p>0x016f2818 is a signature for boot loaders to identify the image
as a linux kernel zImage. This is at a physical offset 0x24 from
the start of the actual zImage and can be used to verify whether
a given image is actually a compressed linux kernel. In the case
of a relocation, this would probably help a bootloader detect a bootable
zImage. We now preserve r0,r1 by storing them in r8,r7 so that the
scratch registers are available for manipulation through the rest
of the code.</p>
<p>r8 = #0</p>
<p>r7 = r1</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>r7 and r8 will be preserved henceforth and not be modified by
any of the code that will uncompress the kernel! we could go ahead
and play with r8 (which is almost hardcoded as #0), but preserve
r7 at all costs.</li>
<li>Some boot loaders (notably angel) do not set the SVC mode before
entering, hence there is specific code to make sure that we are in
supervisor mode before starting to uncompress the kernel. It is explicitly
checked at this point. If we are not in SVC mode, we enter SVC mode
here.</li>
<li>Machine specific code (like head-xscale.S or head-sa1100.S) is
now executed HERE.</li>
<li>All machine specific initialization is completed at this point
(this might include flushing data caches, setting any machine specific
registers), and control returns here.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>This part of the kernel is written to provide relocation capabilities.
A GOT (Global Offset Table) is defined and used for the purpose of
relocation. At this point, the code actually checks the GOT and makes
sure that any offsets are redefined if we are executing from a different
location from what was expecetd. </p>
<p>The code works as follows:</p>
<p>LC0 contains the GOT which can be used for relocating the code.</p>
<p>
</p><pre>LC0: .word LC0 @ r1
.word __bss_start @ r2
.word _end @ r3
.word _load_addr @ r4
.word _start @ r5
.word _got_start @ r6
.word _got_end @ ip
.word user_stack+4096 @ sp
LC1: .word reloc_end - reloc_start
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Look for the GOT at where it should have been, if it is not found
at this location, then find that offset to the actual GOT and store
the new offset values to the GOT.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>note:</b></dt><dd><p>r7,r8 are preserved during this operation (actually
they are preserved almost through the rest of the code)</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>This entire operation is to fixup C references. uncompress_kernel()
and some of the functions used by it are actually C references and
require the GOT to be setup and available before they can be used.
 </li>
<li>at this point the GOT references have been fixed and the ip has
also been fixed. </li>
<li>not_relocated:</li>
<li>all content from '_bss_start' to '_end' are filled with zeroes
(0)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>r2 = _bss_start, r3 = _end from the GOT</p>
<p>
</p><pre>not_relocated: mov r0, #0
1: str r0, [r2], #4 @ clear bss
str r0, [r2], #4
str r0, [r2], #4
str r0, [r2], #4
cmp r2, r3
blo 1b
</pre>
<p></p>
<h3>Enabling the Cache (cache_on)</h3>

<p>enable the cache now, do NOT touch r4 while doing so</p>
<p>
</p><pre>set r3 := #8 
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>this is the offset to find the cache_on routine from the processor
cache entry tables. (refer to the processor_info table below - ptr_cache_on
is at offset #8)</p>
<p>
</p><pre>call call_cache_fn 
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>this routine actually chooses which cache functions to run based
on the processor id and the offset supplied (r3). </p>
<p>The <em>proc_types</em> table is laid out as follows:</p>
<p>for each processor there is an identical record that lists out</p>
<p>| proc_types |</p>
<p>- processor_id -</p>
<p>- processor_mask -</p>
<p>- ptr_cache_on -</p>
<p>- { return mov pc,lr } -</p>
<p>the last record is</p>
<p>- 0 -</p>
<p>- 0 -</p>
<p>- { mov pc, lr } -</p>
<p>- { mov pc, lr } -</p>
<p>- { return mov pc,lr } -</p>
<p>As observed, the last record would forcibly return to the caller
(and initiate an error indicating that the processor was not identified).</p>
<p>the appropriate cache function [ptr_cache_on] is called
by a direct branch (without modifying the link register lr)</p>
<p>
</p><pre>set r12 := lr
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>PS:</b></dt><dd><p>every arch specific cache_on preserves lr by copying
it to r12. It may be possible that lr is affected when the cache
is initialized**</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<p>( the cache function finally returns with a mov pc,r12 )</p>
<h3>Decompress the kernel</h3>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>this depends on the fact that r4, r5 were preserved through all
previous routines (after relocating, reading in the GOT).</li>
<li>we need to create space for a kernel before decompressing it,
that is done by allocating stack space and ensuring that we don't
run into the kernel while doing so.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><pre>r1 := sp
r2 := sp + 64K
if r4 &gt; r2 &lt;em&gt;(_load_addr &gt; sp+64K)? do wont_overwrite()
r0 := r4 + 4M
if r0 &lt; r5 &lt;em&gt;(_load_addr + 4M &lt; _start)? do wont_overwrite()
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>In case we run into the kernel (within our stack space), we need
to workaround overwriting the kernel on decompression </p>
<p>
</p><pre>r1 := r5 + r0 (_start + _length) - _end of kernel
r2 := _start
r3 := *LC1 (reloc_end - reloc_start)
r3 := r2 + r3 (_start + reloc_length)
copy relocation code from _start to _end
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>parameters to decompress_kernel() are now assigned before calling</p>
<p>
</p><pre>r5 := r2 (sp +64K)
r0 := r5 (sp +64K)
r3 := r7 (r7 = architecture_id)
decompress_kernel()
</pre>
<p></p>
<p><b>wont_overwrite()</b> is called when it is safe to proceed with the
initial addresses and stack space assignments. This is the ideal
case and the simplest one with no complications.</p>
<p>
</p><pre>r0 := r4 ( _load_addr of kernel )
r3 := r7 ( architecture_id )
decompress_kernel()
call_kernel()
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>decompress_kernel() is actually a C routine (there is a comment
where the GOT is setup, stating that the GOT is required to be properly
setup for accessing C calls).</p>
<h3>Call Kernel</h3>

<p>
</p><pre>do cache_clean_flush() -- flush the caches softly!
do cache_off() -- turn off all caches
r0 := #0
r1 := r7 (architecture_id)
mov pc, r4 (r4 = _load_addr)
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>The kernel should start executing at this point (you'll have
to refer to code in kernel/head.S to trace further execution).</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>

<p><b>Flushing the D-Cache</b></p>
<p><em>cache_clean_flush()</em></p>
<p>
</p><pre>r1 := pc &amp; ~(31) /** bic r1, pc, #31 */
r2 := r1 + 64K (64K is twice the size of 32K - max d-cache size)
while( r1 &lt; r2) {
r12 = *r1
r1 += 8
}
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>this traversal of memory twice the size of the maximum possible
d-cache (which is 32K) is supposed to ensure a complete flush of
the d-cache. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="ss1.4">1.4</a> <a href="http://amitshah.bizhat.com/arm/arm_linux_boot.html#toc1.4">kernel/head.S</a>
</h2>

<p>This is the actual start of the kernel (sans any decompression
code).</p>
<p>(was head-arm[vo].S in 2.4.xx kernels and has now been
merged into a single file.)</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The file starts with a check (TEXT_ADDR &amp; 0xffff) != 0x8000
 </li>
<li>This is because the page tables are placed 16K below the actual
text address and we need to have at least that much space ensured.
Though 0x8000 is 32K, this option may be relaxed to PAGE_OFFSET +
0x4000 in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>(PS: This is why all TEXTADDR end with 0x8000)</p>
<p>ENTRY(stext) in this file actually executes from TEXTADDR</p>
<p>At this point, the following state is assumed</p>
<hr>
<em>MMU: off</em>
<hr>
<hr>
<em>I-Cache: - don't bother -</em>
<hr>
<hr>
<em>D-Cache: off</em>
<hr>
<hr>
<em>r0: 0</em>
<hr>
<hr>
<em>r1: architecture_id (sourced from mach-types)</em>
<hr>
<p>This code can also be called by a bootloader (which can uncompress
the kernel by itself or run an uncompressed kernel image) and hence
should also be able to execute without any special settings or helpers.</p>
<h3>ENTRY(stext)</h3>

<p>We now force ourselves to enter SVC mode irrespective of the
mode we are in during entry.</p>
<p>(set CPSR_C using r0 - saving original r0 to r12)</p>
<p>CPSR_C := PSR_F_BIT | PSR_I_BIT | MODE_SVC</p>
<p>enter SVC mode with FIQs and IRQs turned off</p>
<h3>lookup_processor_type()</h3>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>this identifies the processor and points to the base of a table
that contains a list of magic numbers and functions specific to a
given processor type. The table used here is like the proc_types
table, though not identical and serves a similar purpose.</li>
<li>we have access to a table with pointers to the actual proc_info
record. The actual structures can be found at arch/arm/mm/proc-*.S</li>
<li>These are filled up by the linker script arch/arm/vmlinux*.lds
with entries from arch/arm/mm/proc-$(PROCESSOR).S</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>__proc_info_end</b></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><b>__proc_info_begin</b></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><b>[table]</b></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><b>__arch_info_begin</b></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><b>__arch_info_end</b></dt><dd>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<hr>
<em>r5 := &amp;__proc_info_end (actually the start of the table).</em>
<hr>
<hr>
<em>using r5 it loads the following</em>
<hr>
<hr>
<em>r7 := __proc_info_end</em>
<hr>
<hr>
<em>r9 := __proc_info_begin</em>
<hr>
<hr>
<em>r10:= [table]</em>
<hr>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>it converts these addresses to our address space (relocates them
if necessary).</li>
<li>r10 finally contains a pointer to the first available processor_id
in the table</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>It traverses the table, the first two entries in the table are</p>
<p>[processor_id]</p>
<p>[mask]</p>
<p>It uses </p>
<p>
</p><pre>mrc p15, 0, r9, c0, c0 @ get processor id
r6 := processor_mask &amp; r9
if ( r6 == processor_id ) { return; }
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>at this point r10 := _proc_info or '0' depending on whether
a match was made. We can easily check whether the processor was identified
by checking the value of r10.</p>
<p>
</p><pre>if( r10 == 0 ) { exit( err = 'p' ) }
</pre>
<p></p>
<h3>lookup_architecture_type()</h3>

<p>This uses the value of r1 that was passed through to identify
the actual machine type. It parses through a table just like __lookup_processor_type()
till it hits a match.</p>
<p>This returns:</p>
<p>r5 := Physical Start Address of RAM</p>
<p>r6 := Physical Start Address of I/O</p>
<p>r7 := byte offset into page tables for I/O</p>
<p>Again, we can check whether we had a positive identification
by checking r7.</p>
<p>if( r7 == 0 ) { exit( err = 'a' ) }</p>
<h3>create_page_tables()</h3>

<p>The page tables are located at address of 'stext' - 0x4000 this
is exactly 16k below the actual start of the kernel.</p>
<p>This is done using the <b>pgtbl</b> macro which takes an extra rambase
parameter that is never used**. The entire 0x4000 (16K) 1 level table
is cleared with '0's 4 MB of space is mapped as pages of 1 MB each
and the rest is aligned on a 32MB boundary. If a serial debug is
required before paging_init() is called, the serial device (if it
is external to the processor) also must be mapped through this table.
If the serial device is through the processor, then you would have
to know the virtual address of the serial device after the initial
page mapping is done. CONFIG_DEBUG_LL selects whether the serial
device is mapped here. There are certain architecture specific initialization
code required here if serial debugging on an external UART is required.</p>
<p>lr = &amp;<em>__turn_mmu_on()</em></p>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt><dd><p>This was __ret() in 2.4.xx</p>
</dd></dl>
<p></p>
<p>The adr psuedo-op is used here to ensure that the code remains
completely relocatable. r10 contains the base address of 'xxx_proc_info'
table where xxx is the processor identified by __lookup_processor_type().</p>
<p>
</p><pre>pc = r10 + #12
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>this actually jumps to ___xxx_setup()</p>
<p>The MMU is setup at this point and activated. (the lr actually
points to __turn_mmu_on(), and hence mov pc,lr jumps there). Once
the MMU is setup, control will now be passed to __mmap_switched.</p>
<h3>mmap_switched()</h3>

<p>This is the last function called inside head.S after which control
is passed to 'start_kernel' (which is located in entry-arm[vo].S)</p>
